# BooksAndAuthorsAPI Project
This repository is a small project designed to practice implementing the MVC architectural pattern in ASP.NET Core while working on a Web API.
The project focuses on building a cleanly structured application with controllers, services, and models, demonstrating the flow of data and the separation of concerns.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

    Implement the MVC pattern in a simple ASP.NET Core Web API.
    Create structured and modular code using controllers, services, and models.
    Build and expose a functional API endpoint for retrieving data (GET /api/authors).
    Organize an ASP.NET Core project with a logical folder structure for maintainability.
    Understand the flow of data between the model, service, and controller layers.
